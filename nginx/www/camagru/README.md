# Camagru
Camagru is Instagram-like web application, which allows users to take picture with sticker, upload picture with sticker, like and comment on other people's posts.

Since this project is 42 Silicon Valley School project, I had to follow instructions given by the school.
Please check the subject from here : https://github.com/Naksi96/camagru/blob/master/md/camagru.en.pdf

Camagru is my second web project. Front-end was done by HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Javascript(without JQuery).
Back-end was only done by PHP, and MySQL was used for the database.

*Webcam access cannot be done in Google Chrome due to the security issue.
Please try it on Firefox.*
